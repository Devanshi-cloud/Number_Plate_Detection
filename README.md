-> The code imports the cv2 and numpy libraries.
-> It loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for detectinglicense plates.
-> A Haar Cascade classifier is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm that is used to detect objects in images or videos.
-> The XML file "haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml" is a Haar Cascade classifier file that contains the trained classifier information for detecting Russian license plates. It is used to detect the location and size of the license plates in the video stream.
